In Database we canm perform CRUD operations:  
    C =  Creat/Insert  
    R = Read/Retrive  
    U = Update/Modify

    The two main feature provided by DBMS are:
        Security
        Authorisation
    In DBMS we can store the data in the form of file format.
    we use query language to interact or communicate with the database.

## Types of DBMS:
Relational Database Management System,
    hierarchical DBMS,
    Network DBMS,
    Object Oriented DBMS,
    NoSQL,

## Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):

    The two main feature provided by DBMS are:

    In RDBMS we can store the data in table format.
    we use sturctured query language to interact or communicate with the database.

## Difference between DBMS and RDBMS


| DBMS | RDBMS |
| :--- | :--- |
| Stores data in files | Stores data in tables |
| Data is stored in one place | Data is stored in multiple linked tables |
| No proper connection between data | Data is connected using IDs (Foreign Keys) |
| More duplicate data (Redundancy) | Less duplicate data (Normalization) |
| Single user | Multiple users |
| General query language is used | Structured Query Language (SQL) is used |
